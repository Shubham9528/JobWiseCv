## Key Components üîç

### Backend (Node.js & Express)

#### Express Application Setup

The backend is set up with Node.js and Express to handle HTTP requests. It also uses `dotenv` for environment variable management, `cors` for handling cross-origin requests, and `body-parser` to parse incoming JSON requests.

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();

const app = express();
app.use(cors());
app.use(bodyParser.json());
```
